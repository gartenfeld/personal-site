			<div class="heading">What are we offering?</div>

			<p>What we sell is the ability to speak another language, and being able to do so in weeks.</p>

			<div class="heading">What products do we make?</div>

			<p>We build software that helps people learn a foreign language. On the front-end, we have web and mobile applications. In the back we have lots of data, about language and about the user. 
			</p>

			<p>We want to build a system that knows an awful lot about the individual user. This evolving data store reflects the progress in the user's head; it grows in value over a lifetime. If it takes $250 per acquisition, we want to make $2500+ from that over a few years.
			</p>

			<p>In the middle we have our secret sauce, the models and mechanisms that understand what the user knows and what the user needs to learn, and deliver exactly the right stuff at the right time for that particular user.
			</p>


			<div class="heading">What is it exactly?</div>

			<p>Is it a language course? Is it an audio CD? Is it a stack of web-pages? Is it Rosetta Stone? None of these. What we are building is an &ldquo;intelligent machine&rdquo;. We need to go deeper and see through the fabric of phenomena: how does language work inside the mind? How does it interact with perception and cognition?</p>

			<p>For the user we have HTML/CSS/JS that can deliver text and play media. That's a plain playing field. In the cloud we have the linguistic models, that compute what content we should give to that user. Anyone can make a system that serves content. What we do is to build the intelligence that serves the right content.</p>

			<div class="heading">Why do we have an edge?</div>

			<p>
				Most language apps and games are made by publishers who have little understanding of the science. If anybody can make one, it won't be that good. Books and courses contain gems but the content is static, it doesn't follow the user. You face a drowning volume of general-audience information.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal of teaching is to enable the learner to become fluent, yet few people have deciphered that process well: how do humans acquire a language, or even a single sound? We stand on the shoulders of giants (plus their PhD students). It takes someone 5 years of research (putting probes around people’s head or studying dozens of infants) to make one discovery, we can reap the benefit of their insight in 5 minutes with a few lines of tweaking.
			</p>

			<div class="heading">What is our target market and segment?</div>

			<p>The impression is that the ESL market is big, and customers are willing to pay high prices. We need to test these assumptions and the hypothesis that we can sell to this market.
			</p>

			<p>There are some good indications: in cultures that place a premium on education, language (ESL) has become a very conspicuous and highly valued ability, not only utility, but manifolds in symbolic value. For example, Mike Campbell sells a set of books and recordings for ~US$1,450 in Taiwan, via channels he cultivated through years of classroom training.
			</p>

			<p>We should position ourselves at creating an offering with high added-value and focusing on commanding a premium by making something that really matters to some users (rather than catering to the generic 9-to-99).
			</p>

			<p>As we become profitable, we can also experiment with major European languages because they are easier to model and teach while having a rather mature market.
			</p>

			<div class="heading">Who are the early adopters?</div>

			<p>At a first guess, it would be someone who is driven to make rapid progress, actively searching for promising methods, already knows the basics of English (through prior schooling), and has good access to, and familiar with, technology. It would be students or young professionals who have a strong motivation.
			</p>

			<p>We will study these personae closely, to build a concrete and vivid image, to the point we can visualize them commuting on a subway train, using a certain kind of mobile device (or at home on a larger screen), as if we have a magical camera to understand their activities throughout the day.
			</p>

			<p>These findings will be the basis for figuring out what kind of learning program works for them and what kind of marketing messages they are susceptible to.
			</p>


			<div class="heading">What assumptions are we testing?</div>

			<p>This is the most critical part. We must be able to measure validation and traction. We will describe the various research questions in testable terms, and look at comparable companies and what they have done, or run some tests (e.g. physical posters, landing pages, asking for sign-ups) to answer them.
			</p>

			<p>Some examples of these hypotheses: 
				&ldquo;There are customers who want to learn a foreign language.” 
				&ldquo;Customers are willing to pay to learn a language.” 
				&ldquo;They are receptive to using programs on a computer.” 
				&ldquo;They will use online programs instead of attending classes.” 
				&ldquo;They will pay for online programs.”
				&ldquo;They will sign up if the program does X…” 
			</p>


			<div class="heading">How do we reach our customers?</div>

			<p>“Big Bang” is elusive. It’s more concrete to envisage making something useful and irresistibly beautiful, and build up one true fan at a time. Also from observation, most of the companies need to be there for 3 to 5 years before becoming highly visible (e.g. Busuu). Is this like the laws of physics?
			</p>

			<p>An ideal goal: back then when I searched for ‘note storage software’, the top results were several genuine, substantive, personal and helpful articles, written by various authors; and from reading these, I decided on Evernote. This is what we want to achieve.
			</p>

			<p>“Distribution channels” is a relevant question to study. At the moment what I can imagine is that we’ll have the product on the web, and we get customers to come to it. We can write articles about language learning, about what the users may care about, we can answer questions for the public, we can have a “Dropbox strategy”... Admittedly, we’ve got a lot to learn.
			</p>

			<p>Also, the scenario for “Customer Service” will be, for a long while in the beginning, the same and only people in the company, as in “Everyone’s on the Frontline”. 
			</p>


			<div class="heading">How do we generate revenue?</div>

			<p>Testing the value hypothesis is a gradual, even continuous process. Whether we can charge a monthly subscription, or have a “hard sell” page and ask for a big purchase, or selling various premium functions and packages (which works similarly to in-app purchases), all these can only be answered by actual response from customers.
			</p>

			<p>In principle, we are building something that can lure people in, something that people find useful (and thus find it of value and keep using it). The pricing and revenue models are based on what we find out about acquisition and retention and patterns of usage.
			</p>

			<p>And that is the fundamental hypothesis: we are making something that customers are willing to pay for. 
			Since most costs are fixed, and variable costs are deferrable (we only scale what works), the earlier users start to pay us, the sooner we become a viable business.
			</p>


			<div class="heading">What is our factory of value?</div>

			<p>This is the upper-left section of the Canvas. It explains why we are uniquely positioned to solve the problem: the infrastructure is ripe, the market is ready, and we have the secret sauce.
			</p>

			<p>We are an R&amp;D company in language technology. We apply scientific findings to build software that works; we run the theories through statistical tests on actual users to generate further insight on how people learn, and to make the software better.
			</p>

			<p>On the front-end, we give users content: text, images, audio. Our key activities are not only in creating and sourcing the media materials, but in experimenting and testing in the lab, and figuring out what works, and designing a great interactive experience.
			</p>

			<p>We are deeply immersed in the theories about contextual learning, imagery, glyphs, symbolic representation, and ontology; we have models about how it’s supposed to work. On the other hand, we put these into practice, and we find out what’s actually helpful for users.
			</p>

			<div class="heading">Do we have a funding plan?</div>

			<p>No plans for funding yet, mostly because we have zero metrics and validation at the moment. 
			</p>

			<p>And there is this very basic ideal of looking for people with the hacker-maker spirit, who already enjoy making things, who have a special interest in language, to join and work on developing something that will become a viable business.
			</p>

			<div class="heading">Do we have an exit plan?</div>

			<p>The plan is to become profitable: 37signals, Atlassian, Evernote, or even less known but sustainable companies.
			</p>

			<p>The business itself must be viable. Yet the people running it should have a special dedication to the science of language (rather than just looking for a viable business in any field), in that sense it’s idealistic.
			</p>

			
			<div class="section"></div>	


			<div class="heading">Envoi</div>

			<p>Think of Tesla or Asimov, they might not have the best lives. What we admire about them is that in those moments when they're fully absorbed in their work of love, in their vivid imagination, they have found their own paradise of creativity.
			</p>

			<p>In the same sense we admire every craftsman who's really into something, who finds the entire world happily fading away for a few hours while they poured their focus over a specific pursuit.
			</p>

			<p>A viable business takes some time to get established, it’s like the 3 to 5 years we have seen in other companies, it’s like the laws of physics. And this is what makes it valuable, the barrier created by the tremendous capital outlay that would be involved to maintain a team for that long.
			</p>

			<p>And that is why we have a focus on the ideals, both on the part of intrinsic motivation and enjoyment of just hacking away, and on the 37signals model of emphasizing self-sufficiency. 
			</p>

			<div class="heading">Analogues and Antilogues</div>

			<p>Here is a study of companies who build language-learning related products. It's self-flattering to view them as competitors… personally I believe the market is always big enough for anyone who can make something truly useful and irresistibly beautiful.
			</p>

			<p>Instead, let’s see them as textbook cases from which we can learn: 1) it’s a biographical study of how to become a real company, i.e. how they did it; 2) it’s a survey of the ecology: who thrives in which corners, what are the overlaps and gaps; 3) it’s a clinical manual of the market, lessons of others' hits and misses to shed some light on the many hypotheses we so readily assume about customers.
