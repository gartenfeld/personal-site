			<p><b>Essential:</b></p>

			<p>At the very basic level we must be able to clarify and define our assumptions about who the target users are, with dry testing and metrics. We need to understand our customers. What will they respond to?
			</p>

			<p>Then we can figure out the design of the product. What methods work for our customers? And we test these designs through prototyping, which involves web development. 
			</p>

			<p>We will also work out if we need lexicographers, or licensed content, or if we can source some open libraries (of example sentences etc.) Along the way we'll solve engineering problems, such as data structures for the lexical models.
			</p>


			<p><b>Advanced:</b></p>

			<p>At a more developed stage, we'll get to computational linguistics (e.g. Word-Sense Disambiguation) and more sophisticated maths. We'll also experiment with theories on cognition and learning.
			</p>


			<p><b>External:</b></p>

			<p>
			Recording (sound production) and artwork may be sourced from outside. The key is to find someone who does it <a href="http://www.cognitivemedia.co.uk/" target=_blank>as naturally</a> as breathing (prolific and effortless and stylish).
			</p>

			<div class="heading">Ideological Emphasis</div>

			<p>It's not just a motley crew temporarily banded together. It's a team of people who <b>share a deep interest</b> in design, engineering (problem solving), data, cognitive sciences, and necessarily, language, as well as a &ldquo;fanatical devotion to beauty", of seeing software as a medium of creative expression.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everyone also has good business sense. There's no island of isolation. Empathy is the factor that makes the difference. It's the ability to understand every part of the whole cycle, in terms of how it affects the customer.

			<a href="http://www.startmate.com.au/teams" target=_blank>Startmate</a> described it so well, here are direct quotations:
			</p>

			<p>
				<i>[We]</i> are looking for teams of founders who are primarily <b>technical in nature</b>. Not necessarily ones of academic intelligence but who have a great sense of what it <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html" target=_blank>truly means to be a hacker</a> – to make something with no money and extreme uncertainty. No one wants excuses, you just get it done.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are no set rules but here are some general guides to the types of founding teams that we are looking to work with:
			</p>
			<p>
				- Technical in nature, either as software developers or user experience designers or some aspect of product development. If things don’t go your way immediately, which likely they wont, then the company needs the ability to <b>keep moving forward</b> with very little money. As Winston Churchill once said: “Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.”
			</p>
			<p>
				- <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/19/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-four-lettersjfdi/" target=_blank>JFDI</a>. The world is littered with very intelligent people with fantastic ideas. Entrepreneurs are separated by their ability to get things done with very few resources and under chaotic conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				- Building your company with <b>lean startup principles</b>. The Lean Startup movement is about the pursuit of reducing waste. The largest risk to a startup is that your intended customers won't care. There are <a href="http://www.custdev.com/" target=_blank>a set of principles called ‘Customer Development’</a> that help speed up the search for a repeatable and scalable business model.
			</p>
			<p>
				- A focus on metrics. Opinions and ideas are the lifeblood of startups but they should be validated and metrics should be what eventually steers the ship. If you haven’t seen or read <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-sept-2010-vancouver" target=_blank>Dave McClure’s Metrics for Startups</a> or <a href="http://andrewchen.co/list-of-essays/" target=_blank>Andrew Chen’s list of essays</a>, you should immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
				- A sense of humour. Seriously...
